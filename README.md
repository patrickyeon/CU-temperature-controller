Chuck Temperature Controller
============================

The Electronics Dept. at Carleton University (carleton.ca) has a simple semiconductor probe station that has been developed for use in undergrad labs. The project here is a PID-based controller board for the peltier cooler that keeps the sample under test (and the plate it sits on) at a user-selected temperature.

Controller board schematics should be forthcoming.
